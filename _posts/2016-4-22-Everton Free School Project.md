#Everton Free School Project
Everton Free School is an alternative provision school, run by Everton Football Club, that provides a special educational environment for vulnerable young people aged 14-19.

Right from inception, we stood alongside Everton in strategising and implementing the use of technology for staff and students. With the curriculum of the school very vocation-specific and directed at the abilities and interests of the young people, there was a heavy focus on mobility.

Having this requirement at the forefront of our partnership, we’ve helped Everton Free School and their partners deploy iPad and Mac devices with enterprise-level control throughout the school, to be used in classes, for homework and for managing students.

As the school increases in size, we’ll also be distributing iTunes U across all the devices as a virtual learning environment for staff and students to stay engaged and excited to learn.
