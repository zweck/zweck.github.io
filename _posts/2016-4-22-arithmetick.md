#Arithmetick
__TLDR__
I was approached by a client to create a time code calculator and immediately I began researching current solutions to determine the market. After establishing that the current solutions offer a base10 calculator interface but with options to switch between hours, minutes and seconds. I wanted to approach this challenge from an unbiased perspective, and I considered a base10 calculator interface as such a bias. 

I thus proceeded to model and prototype one of the favored interfaces which consisted of dials. However, after initial prototypes I concluded that draggable areas offered a more cohesive User Experience; this has been refined through a two iterations to deliver Arithmetick v1.2.0.

__The long version__ 
Only a few months in and I have put Arithmetick (our gesture based time calculator) through another major update. Inspired by Dieter Rams "If you try to be different, you'll very rarely be better, but if you try to be better, you'll nearly always be different" now I'm paraphrasing a but here but the sentiment stands. I didn't want to just make a calculator.

I looked at what time calculators existed, and found that they were all essentially normal calculator interfaces, with a time selector option jerry-rigged into the design. In our testing this required many more key presses to gain a result, and thus was a product of its design, a calculator that had the option of selecting time. Not a time calculator.
