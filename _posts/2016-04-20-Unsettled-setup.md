### I have a very 1st world problem
I can't settle on a setup. currently I use a Macbook Pro running Ubuntu, and all in all I'm pretty happy with it. My issues are as follows:

- 15" is too big
- the thing gets really hot
- really really hot
- as a byproduct of the heat, the fans are really noisy

I see other devs on these nice, nimble little Intel core m machines that have no fans and I'm drawn to them. The bliss of no fan, the very real possibility of coding in bed. All of this is very much a win for me. However I have 1 issue, these machines are upwards of Â£700 and have a very real possibility of being too underpowered for my needs. Often I'm running a VM with vagrant, along with watchers and build processes which start to stress out my quad core i5, never mind a dual core 1.2 GHz core m. 

I thought I could satisfy the bed code requirement with an iPad, raspberry pi and VNC. Alas, either I am too lazy or having all of my various projects over 3 devices (I use a desktop too) is getting a bit much. I love git, but sometimes I just forget to push my branches. 

So as I said, a very 1st world problem, but a problem nonetheless. 

My current options are:

- do nothing (unlikely)
- just get an Intel m machine, it'll be fine
- get a surface style machine with a real processor but with fans in the lid

Stay tuned, a decision is pending...
