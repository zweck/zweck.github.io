### Moving away from VScode

We had a good run, and I wasn't like I dissatisfied with VScode but I _was_ surrounded by a bunch of developers using VIM, and I was also getting a bit upset at how much of my RAM VScode was consuming.

I mean, realistically I wasn't that bothered about the resource use, as it resulted in lightening fast text editing for a Electron app, but still, I had to come up with some excuses for my brain to justify the switch outside of _VIM seems cool_.

However, the anti-establishment brat in me recoiled at VIM and it's dogmatic following. So I went on the hunt for a new editor and came across [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org). It had a VIM mode but also loads of cool build in features and lovely little code helpers. 

After spending a few minutes going through `vimtutor` I felt ready enough to just start editing, and also felt like if spacemacs let me down anywhere I could move over to VIM with relatively little pain. 

But after a week of trying to run spacemacs in iTerm I was getting _very_ frustrated at the UI. I mean yes I'm using a terminal based text editor, so there is little to no UI, but I still wanted it to look cool and make me seem like a bad ass for using it. 

Thats when I found http://emacsformacosx.com/ a dedicated emacs shell that I could run totally independently of iTerm. Yes! This was my saviour. 

I've been running this setup for about 6 weeks now and I'm over the moon and completely converted. I keep hitting `:w` in slack to send messages and wish that all text editors had the *NORMAL* / *VISUAL* / *INSERT* mode distinction, it just makes so much more sense to me. When in *NORMAL* mode I have literally tens of keys available to perform specific tasks, whereas _modern_ text editors need you to use various modifier keys to achieve the same thing. 

And the best thing is, I _also_ use VIM. I'm typing this in VIM right now for example; and that's O.K. Horses for courses right, if all I want to do is make a quick change to a config file or sum't similar. VIM's my guy, but if I'm in _project_ mode, then I'm all over spacemacs.
