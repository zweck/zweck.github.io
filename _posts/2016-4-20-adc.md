Whilst working with a digital agency in Macclesfield I was lead developer and UX architect of a project to build a responsive front end for a Drupal and Magento site.

The site would advertise and sell a new kind of diabetes monitor. We created a front end build process that focused on components, using Brad Frosts atomic design principles.

Unfortunately the end result was not used by the client due to account man agent issues, however I really enjoyed this project, and the end result was a solid, responsive website that used the latest techniques to deliver a well rounded experience.

You can preview the front end [here](/examples/fsl/index.html)
