Whilst working with a digital agency in Macclesfield I was lead developer and UX architect of a project to build a responsive frontend for a Drupal and Magento site.

The site would advertise and sell a new kind of diabetes monitor. We created a frontend build process that focused on components, using Brad Frosts atomic design principles.

I really enjoyed this project, and the end result was a robust, responsive website that used the latest techniques to deliver a well rounded experience. Although it was completed in 2014, you can see that it still holds up as an example of graceful degredation and progressive enhancement.
