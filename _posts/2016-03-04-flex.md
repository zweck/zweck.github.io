The client wanted to develop an app for managing clients routines when using his gym. Through simple interations with iPad kiosks the dreams was for a usable, simple solution to routine management and personal training.

I build the foundation of an iOS app using phonegap which intelligently creates and manages users routines, as well as offers business intelligence to the gym owner/manager. Users would scan their QR code to enter login to the iPad kiosk, retrieve their next exercise, and repeat.
