### Electron all the things


I’m in 2 minds about electron apps. As a user, I can find them frustrating and sluggish (_looking at you Slack_), as a developer I find them truly joyful to make and tremendously powerful, and as MS has proven, you can make performing electron apps such as VSCode. And ultimately users don’t have a clue whether its electron or native. 

Thus, I say, electron all the things, the sooner you get on board. The sooner you’ll be having fun making electron apps that rock instead of suck. Yes, I reserve the right to complain about poorly build electron apps, but if more of us strive to build performant apps, then the more choices users have and selfishly, the more choice I have on Linux :)
