I was constantly frustrated at answering my iPhone whilst it lay on a desk, with the flat back they are difficult to pick up, and you can't easily type with them on the desk, so I went about designed and 3D printing a new iPhone dock which I finally put on IndieGoGo.

As highlighted by Bill Moggridge, 11° is the most ergonomic angle for typing. This is why the iPads’ SmartCover angles the iPad to exactly 11°. The Official iPhone Dock angles the iPhone to an unusable angle.

The 11° Dock is a simple solution as it holds the iPhone at this optimal angle. It amplifies the sound from the device, has a finger grip on the back for easy removal and supports the iPhone 4/4S/5 and 5S.
