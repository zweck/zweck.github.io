I was approached by a client who wanted a time calculator for camera men, predominantly for the BBC. He wanted an iphone app that could easily calculate the time.

I began researching current solutions to get an idea of the market. All of the current solutions offer a base10 calculator interface but with options to switch between hours, minutes and seconds. I wanted to approach this challenge from an unbiased perspective, as if you were designing a time calculator for the first time. 

I designed a model and prototype one of the favored interfaces which consisted of dials. However, after initial prototypes I concluded that draggable areas offered a more cohesive User Experience.
