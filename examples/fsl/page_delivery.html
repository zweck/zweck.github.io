            <h2>Can I ask for the FreeStyle Libre system to be delivered to a country other than my own?</h2>
            <p> Deliveries can only be sent to addresses in the country where the FreeStyle Libre web shop is based, see address details below.</p>
            <h2>Can an order be sent to several addresses?</h2>
            <p>One specific order can only be sent to one specific address. You can store up to 5 different delivery addresses (all in the same country) in your account.</p>
            <h2>What are the shipping costs and rules?</h2>
            <p>We offer Express (1-2 day) and Standard (2-4 day) delivery options (not valid for remote regions/islands).</p>
            <h2>My order hasn’t arrived, what should I do?</h2>
            <p>Visit the Your Account page to see a delivery estimate for your order. If this date has passed with no sign of your delivery then we recommend that you ask the carrier's local depot if they've already tried to deliver it, or ask your neighbour if the package has been left with them. If there's still no sign of your order please check the My Orders page for help.</p>
            <h2>Undeliverable order</h2>
            <p>Occasionally parcels are returned to us as undeliverable. As we can’t re-dispatch orders that have been returned to us, if a carrier returns a parcel to us as undeliverable we’ll issue you a full refund, including the delivery costs. If you’d still like to purchase the items in the parcel you’ll need to place a new order.</p>
            <p>A parcel might be returned as undeliverable for several reasons: </p>
            <p>• Incorrect address: If the address is incorrect or outdated the parcel will typically be returned to   us by the carrier or the unintended recipient. Please double-check the address carefully when   placing your order.</p>
            <p>• Failed delivery attempts: Most of our carriers will make more than one attempt to deliver a   parcel. If they find that they can’t successfully deliver your parcel it will be returned to us.</p>
            <p>• Refused by recipient: A gift recipient who isn’t expecting a gift may refuse a parcel if they   believe it’s being delivered to them by mistake. In this case we’ll refund the gift purchaser and   let them know by e-mail. If you want to place a new order for the gift, you may want to let the   recipient know that a surprise is on the way.</p>
            <p>• Illegible address: In rare cases address labels may become illegible in transit. If that happens a   carrier will return the parcel to us.</p>
            <p>• Damaged in transit: If a parcel is damaged while it's on its way to you the carrier may return it    without attempting delivery</p>
            <h2>Can I track my delivery?</h2>
            <p>Yes, after an order has dispatched, many parcels can be tracked on XXXXX.web. You can find tracking information in your order details.</p>
            <p>To track your parcel: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Go to My Orders</li>
              <li>Go to the order you want to track</li>
              <li>Click Track Package </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please keep in mind that some items may be dispatched separately and therefore may not arrive at the same time as the rest of your order.</p>
            <p>If your package shows as delivered, but you haven't yet received it, go to About Missing Parcels That Show as Delivered for more information.</p>
            <h2>How can I find an order that shows as delivered?</h2>
            <p>Most orders arrive on time. Occasionally though, the tracking may show as "delivered" when you don't have your order. If the tracking for your order shows it as delivered but you haven't received it, you should:</p>
            <p>• Check if someone else at your address has accepted it</p>
            <p>• Look around the delivery location. Your order may have been left with a neighbour or in a safe place   like a porch or garage.</p>
            <p>• Look for a notification of attempted delivery. You may find an attempted delivery notice in your letter     box or on your door. Follow the instructions on that notice to request redelivery or to arrange collection</p>
            <p>• Contact the carrier. Ask if they have additional information about where your order is. Make sure you    have your tracking number or delivery confirmation number handy. To find contact information about    your carrier go to About Our Carriers. Note: Some carriers may deliver until 10 pm.</p>
            <h2>Contacting our carriers</h2>
            <p>If you have a tracking number for your order, the carrier may have more information than the FreeStyle Libre website. When you place an order include a contact phone number with your delivery address. If there's any issue with the delivery, the carrier will use that number to contact you.</p>
            <p>We work with a number of carriers to make sure that you receive your items as fast as possible. As a result, your parcel may sometimes travel through other countries before reaching you. The estimated delivery date provided when you place your order takes this travel time into account.</p>
            <p>The table below provides a complete list of the various carriers we use, arranged alphabetically. Click on the carrier's name in the table to open their website. Each link below will take you to an external website which operates independently to the FreeStyle Libre website. If clicking a link to a carrier's tracking website doesn't work, try copying and pasting it into your browser's address bar.</p>
