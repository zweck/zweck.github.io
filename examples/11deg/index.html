					<h5>The idea began about 12 months ago, I was in work, my iPhone on charge in the Apple dock and texting at the same time, I couldn't believe how frustrating it was trying to text and charge at the same time.</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<h5>The steep angle meant that I had to twist my hand. I looked online for a dock with a shallower angle, and when I couldn't find one, I decided to design one myself. </h5>
				</div>
				<div class="copy">
					<h5>My designs are heavily influenced by the 1950's and 60's modernism, using companies such as Vitsœ, Braun and Apple as benchmarks of good design. The 11° Dock presents your iPhone 4/4s/5 or 5s ready for use on your desk.</h5>

				<h3>Support Us</h3>
				<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/11-degree-dock/x/6409227"><img src="img/indiegogo-logo-light.png"></a>
				<p class="copy">We have completed the design phase and prototyped the product. After numerous iterations and tweaks we are ready for manufacturing but we need support to bring this to reality, the tooling cost is too high for us to support on our own, so we are asking for anyone else who sees our vision to support us through Indiegogo. </p>
				<p class="copy">We are passionate about bringing this product to market, and have therefore decided to reward all of our Indiegogo supporters. We believe in bringing good design to everyone, and because of this belief we are offering the dock at the lowest possible price to our Indiegogo supporters.</p>
				<p class="copy">We have a range of other exciting products in the pipeline, and by supporting us you will not only get an 11&deg Dock reward, but also be rewarded with a discount on all future products as a thanks for joining us in our vision to bring good desgin at an affordable price.</p>
